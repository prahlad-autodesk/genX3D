    "In **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, the general **standard pattern** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MCP Servers** = provide *tools, resources, templates* (domain-specific capabilities: databases, APIs, CAD ops, RAG stores, etc.).\n",
    "* **Clients (Agents/Hosts)** = orchestrate reasoning with the LLM, decide *which MCP server and tool to call*.\n",
    "* **LLM** = almost always runs in the **host/client layer**, not inside the MCP server.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LLMs usually stay outside MCP servers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separation of concerns**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * MCP server = deterministic tool provider.\n",
    "   * LLM = nondeterministic reasoning engine.\n",
    "     Keeping them separate avoids entangling reasoning with tool logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reusability**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * One LLM can coordinate across many MCP servers.\n",
    "   * If you put the LLM *inside* a server, that server becomes less reusable and tied to a specific model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance & control**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Hosts can decide which LLM to use (Claude, GPT-4, Llama 3, fine-tuned Starcoder, etc.).\n",
    "   * Easier to swap models without touching MCP server code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When does it make sense to put an LLM in an MCP server?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the LLM is treated as a **tool itself** (e.g., a \"summarize\\_text\" tool, \"CAD-to-natural-language\" tool).\n",
    "* If you want multiple clients to share the same fine-tuned model behind an MCP service.\n",
    "* If the LLM has **domain-specific fine-tuning** tightly bound to the serverâ€™s functionality (e.g., `cad-generator-server` wrapping Starcoder-Finetuned as a tool).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### In your GenX3D Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Best practice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Keep **Llama 3.2** and **Starcoder FT** in the **backend host/agents layer** (CAD Editor Agent, CAD Generator Agent).\n",
    "  * They orchestrate with MCP servers (`mcp-cad-server`, `mcp-cadgen-server`) for deterministic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Optional hybrid:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If you want Starcoder FT to act like a **CAD code generator service**, you can expose it as a **tool inside `mcp-cadgen-server`**.\n",
    "  * Then agents just call `\"generate_cad_code(prompt)\"` via MCP, and the server handles inference with Starcoder FT.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ So the **standard** = LLMs in **host/clients (agents)**.\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ But you *can* wrap fine-tuned models as MCP server tools if you want to make them reusable across multiple agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you want me to adjust your architecture so that **Starcoder FT is exposed as a tool in `mcp-cadgen-server`** while keeping **Llama 3.2** in the client/agent layer? That would give you both flexibility and reusability.\n"
