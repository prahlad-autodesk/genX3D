The error indicates that your Docker image was built for a different platform (likely `linux/arm64` on your Mac) but Render requires `linux/amd64`. Here's how to fix this:

## **1. Rebuild the image for the correct platform**

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t cascade-studio-app .
```
Great! The image has been rebuilt for the `linux/amd64` platform. Now let's tag and push it to Docker Hub:

## **2. Tag the image for Docker Hub**

```bash
docker tag cascade-studio-app ps2program/genx3d:latest
```
## **3. Login to Docker Hub**

```bash
docker login
```
## **4. Push the image to Docker Hub**

```bash
docker push ps2program/genx3d:latest
```
Perfect! Your Docker image has been successfully pushed to Docker Hub. Now you can deploy it on Render:

## **âœ… Image is now available at:**
```
ps2program/genx3d:latest
```

## **ðŸš€ Deploy on Render:**

1. **Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)**
2. **Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"**
3. **Choose "Deploy from Docker image"**
4. **Enter your Docker image URL:**
   ```
   ps2program/genx3d:latest
   ```
5. **Configure:**
   - **Name:** `genx3d`
   - **Environment:** `Docker`
   - **Port:** `8000`
   - **Health Check Path:** `/` (or your health endpoint)

## **ðŸ”§ Environment Variables (if needed):**
If you have environment variables, add them in Render's service settings under "Environment".

## **ðŸ“± Your app will be available at:**
```
https://your-app-name.onrender.com
```

The image is now built for `linux/amd64` and should work perfectly on Render!

# INITIAL SETUP

Perfect! Let's update the Docker image name to `genx3d`. Here are the commands:

## **1. Tag your image for Docker Hub with the new name**

```sh
docker tag cascade-studio-app ps2program/genx3d:latest
```

## **2. Login to Docker Hub**

```sh
docker login
```
(You'll be prompted for your Docker Hub username and password)

## **3. Push the image**

```sh
docker push ps2program/genx3d:latest
```

---

## **Alternative: Tag with a specific version**

```sh
# Tag with version
docker tag cascade-studio-app ps2program/genx3d:v1.0.0

# Push the versioned tag
docker push ps2program/genx3d:v1.0.0
```

---

## **After pushing, others can pull your image with:**

```sh
docker pull ps2program/genx3d:latest
```

Would you like me to run these commands for you, or do you want to execute them manually?
