To create a **backup of your Docker image**, you can export it as a `.tar` file using the `docker save` command:

---

### ✅ **Step 1: Save the image as a tar file**

```bash
docker save -o genx3d_backup.tar genx3d
```

* `-o genx3d_backup.tar`: Output file name
* `genx3d`: The name of the image you built

---

### ✅ **Step 2: (Optional) Compress it**

If the image is large, compress it:

```bash
gzip genx3d_backup.tar
```

This will create: `genx3d_backup.tar.gz`

---

### ✅ **To restore the image later**

```bash
docker load -i genx3d_backup.tar
```

Or if compressed:

```bash
gunzip -c genx3d_backup.tar.gz | docker load
```

---

Let me know if you want to push it to Docker Hub or a private registry instead.
